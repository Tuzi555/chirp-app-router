## What is Chirp

Chirp is a hobby project based on tutorial by [t3dotgg](https://github.com/t3dotgg) taken further.

In the tutorial Theo shows hot to build a Twitter clone using Next.js (pages router) and other
technologies. With introduction of Next.js 13 and its App router, I decided to build it again from
ground up using the App router.

It is still a work in progress but the core functionality is there.
